# EmotionalChatbot-Webhook
This project proposes a student model based on emotions and personality profiles in order to develop the affective profile of the student in a Virtual Learning Environments. With the information contained in the student model will be selected pedagogical strategies appropriate to each profile. For the validation of this approach, techniques of Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Tree were used. The analysis have as a result an overall accuracy 97.28 % in the classification of the nine personality profiles, as well as the validation of the set of pedagogical strategies. Thus, by detecting an harmful emotion to the learning, the student will receive personalized stimuli of their characteristics and, consequently, the approximation of the emotion that promotes learning
